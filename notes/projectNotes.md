# Project Overview

This document provides an overview of the key components of our project that we will need to present later.

## Task Management

For task management, we utilized Clickup. This tool helped us to organize our tasks, assign them to team members, and track our progress.

## ID Generation

One of the main features of our project was the generation of identification cards. The code for this feature can be found in the [idCards folder](/idCards/).

## Database Management

We used SQL for our database management. This involved creating tables to store and manage our data.

## Code Style Consistency

To ensure consistency in our code, we established a set of coding rules. These rules can be found in our [Code of Conduct](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This helped us to maintain a clean and readable codebase, making it easier for team members to understand and contribute to the code.
