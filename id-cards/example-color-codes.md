# Possible Color Codes

In our project, we use color codes to distinguish between different roles. Here are some examples:

- ![GREEN](https://placehold.co/15x15/green/green.png) `PROJECT MANAGEMENT`: This color is used for individuals who are part of the project management team.
- ![BLUE](https://placehold.co/15x15/blue/blue.png) `PRESS / PHOTOGRAPHER`: This color is used for individuals who are part of the press team or are photographers.
- ![RED](https://placehold.co/15x15/red/red.png) `SCHOOL MEDICAL SERVICE`: This color is used for individuals who are part of the school medical service team.
- ![PURPLE](https://placehold.co/15x15/purple/purple.png) `EXTERN`: This color is used for individuals who came from outside the school.
