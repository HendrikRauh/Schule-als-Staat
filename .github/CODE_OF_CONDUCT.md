# Code Style Guidelines

In this project, we adhere to a specific coding style to ensure consistency and readability. Here are the key points:

- **Indentation:** Use **4 spaces** for each level of indentation.

- **Lists:** Use `-` for bullet points in markdown files.

- **Language:** All code and comments should be **written in English**. Please **pay close attention to spelling and grammar**.

- **Braces (`{` and `}`):** Place the opening brace (`{`) on the **same line as the statement** that requires it. Start a **new line for the closing brace (`}`)**.

- **Semicolons (`;`):** Start a **new line after each semicolon (`;`)**. Avoid multiple statements per line.

- **Paths:** Use **relative paths** whenever possible. This makes the code more portable and easier to manage.

- **Git Commit Messages:** Write a **descriptive message** for each commit. It should briefly describe the changes made and the reason for them.

- **Variable Naming:** Use **camelCase** for variable names. This means starting with a lowercase letter and capitalizing the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word.

- **Descriptive Naming:** Use **descriptive names** for variables, functions, classes, etc. The name should reflect the purpose or functionality of the element it represents. **Avoid using abbreviations or single-letter names**.
