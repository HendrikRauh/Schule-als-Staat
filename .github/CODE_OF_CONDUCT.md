# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Codestyle

We follow a specific coding style in this project. Here are the key points:

- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces for each level of indentation.
- **List:** Use `-` for bullet points.
- **Language:** Write in English. Please pay attention to spelling.
- **Braces (`{` and `}`):** Place the opening brace (`{`) on the same line as the statement that requires it. Start a new line for the closing brace (`}`).
- **After `;`:** Start a new line after each semicolon (`;`).
- **Path:** Use relative paths.
- **Git commit message:** Write a descriptive message for each commit.
- **Variable Naming:** Use camelCase for variable names. This means starting with a lowercase letter and capitalizing the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, etc. The name should reflect the purpose or functionality of the element it represents.
