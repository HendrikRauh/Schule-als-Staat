# Code Style Guidelines

In this project, we adhere to a specific coding style to ensure consistency and readability. Here are the key points:

## Code Formatting

- **Braces (`{` and `}`):** Place the opening brace (`{`) on the **same line as the statement** that requires it. Start a **new line for the closing brace (`}`)**.

- **Indentation:** Use **4 spaces** for each level of indentation.

- **Semicolons (`;`):** Start a **new line after each semicolon (`;`)**. Avoid multiple statements per line.
 
- **Spacing:** Include spaces between different parts of your code to improve readability. This includes between functions, classes, and blocks of code within functions.

- **Trailing New Line:** Ensure that each file ends with a trailing new line. This helps with version control systems like Git and improves code readability.

## Documentation

- **Commenting:** Add comments to your code where necessary. This helps others understand the purpose and functionality of your code.

- **File Description Comments:** Each code file should start with a comment block that describes the purpose and functionality of the file. This comment block should be formatted as follows:
```javascript
/*
* This file contains a function that does something.
* The function takes in a string and returns a modified string.
* The modification process involves several steps, each explained in the function.
*/
```

## Naming Conventions

- **Descriptive Naming:** Use **descriptive names** for variables, functions, classes, etc. The name should reflect the purpose or functionality of the element it represents. **Avoid using abbreviations or single-letter names**.

- **Variable and Function Naming:** Use **camelCase** for variable and function names. This means starting with a lowercase letter and capitalizing the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word. For example, ˋmyVariableNameˋ, ˋcalculateSumˋ.

- **Class Naming:** Use **PascalCase** for class names, so start with capital letter and then capitalize the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word. For example, ˋMyClassNameˋ.

- **File Naming:** Use **kebab-case** for file names. This means all lowercase letters and the words are joined with a dash (ˋ-ˋ). For example, ˋmy-file-name.jsˋ.

## Project Management

- **Git Commit Messages:** Write a **descriptive message** for each commit. It should briefly describe the changes made and the reason for them.

- **Lists:** Use `-` for bullet points in markdown files.

- **Paths:** Use **relative paths** whenever possible. This makes the code more portable and easier to manage.

- **Project Structure:** Organize related files into separate folders for each project (e.g., idCards, forms, etc.). This helps keep the codebase clean and easy to navigate.

## Language

- **Language:** All code and comments should be **written in English**. Please **pay close attention to spelling and grammar**.
