# Schule als Staat

"Schule als Staat" is a school project that turns the school into a "state" inhabited by students and teachers. This interactive project allows students to simulate a state structure and learn about politics, economics and decision-making.

## Libraries that are used in this project
- [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3), a fast and simple library for SQLite3 in Node.js
- [fast-csv](https://github.com/C2FO/fast-csv), a library for parsing and formatting CSV-files or any other delimited value file in Node.js
- [node-qrcode](https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode), a library for generating QR codes

## Task management

For task management we use [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/). This tool helps us to organize our tasks, assign them to team members and track our progress.

## ID card generation

One of the first features of our project is the generation of identification cards. The code for this feature can be found in the [id-cards folder](/main/id-cards/).

## Database Management

We use SQL to manage our database. This involves creating tables to store and manage our data.

## Code Style Consistency

To ensure consistency in our code, we have established a set of coding rules. These rules can be found in our [Code of Conduct](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This helps us maintain a clean and readable codebase, making it easier for team members to understand and contribute to the code.

## Surveys

We use [Microsoft Forms](https://forms.office.com/) to handle high traffic surveys and data visualization. This tool allows us to create surveys and polls, collect responses in real time, and display automatic charts to visualize the data.

## ID Card Scanning

For scanning of the identification cards, we use a WPF application built with the .NET Framework in C#. This allows us to efficiently scan and process the ID cards generated for the project.

## Software Architecture

### Backend

The backend of our application is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Node.js is a JavaScript runtime based on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows us to build scalable network applications and perform asynchronous operations, making it ideal for the needs of our project.

### Frontend

The frontend of our application is built using JavaScript. JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. It allows us to create interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
