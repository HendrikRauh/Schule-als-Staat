# Schule als Staat

## Description

"Schule als Staat" is a school project where the school is transformed into a "state" inhabited by students and teachers for a certain period of time. This project provides an interactive environment for students and teachers to engage deeply with the concepts of politics and economics.

For the project, students simulate a state structure which they develop themselves. Through this role-playing exercise, students learn more about forms of government, constitution, political decisions, and economics. They also practice their social-communicative and methodological skills.

The project involves several stages including preparation, implementation, and post-processing. Throughout these stages, students work on a constitution, develop an economic system, found parties and institutions, and elect a government. Reflection and learning from the experiences collectively form an important part of the project.

## Task Management

For task management, we utilized Clickup. This tool helped us to organize our tasks, assign them to team members, and track our progress.

## ID Generation

One of the main features of our project was the generation of identification cards. The code for this feature can be found in the [idCards folder](/idCards/).

## Database Management

We used SQL for our database management. This involved creating tables to store and manage our data.

## Code Style Consistency

To ensure consistency in our code, we established a set of coding rules. These rules can be found in our [Code of Conduct](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This helped us to maintain a clean and readable codebase, making it easier for team members to understand and contribute to the code.
