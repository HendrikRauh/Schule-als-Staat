# Schule als Staat

## Description

"Schule als Staat" is a school project where the school is transformed into a "state" inhabited by students and teachers for a certain period of time. This project provides an interactive environment for students and teachers to engage deeply with the concepts of politics and economics.

For the project, students simulate a state structure which they develop themselves. Through this role-playing exercise, students learn more about forms of government, constitution, political decisions, and economics. They also practice their social-communicative and methodological skills.

The project involves several stages including preparation, implementation, and post-processing. Throughout these stages, students work on a constitution, develop an economic system, found parties and institutions, and elect a government. Reflection and learning from the experiences collectively form an important part of the project.
